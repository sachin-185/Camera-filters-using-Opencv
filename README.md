# Camera-filters-using-Opencv

Overview:

This project implements real-time camera filters using OpenCV, allowing users to apply various visual effects to live video streams. It leverages OpenCV’s powerful image processing capabilities to create custom filters such as grayscale, sepia, sketch effects, and AI-driven enhancements

### **Project Outline: Camera Filters Using OpenCV**  

#### **Installation**  
Besides installing OpenCV, this project requires additional packages for extended functionality.  

- OpenCV – Core library for image processing.  
- NumPy – Efficient matrix operations.  

Installation command:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

#### **Basic Features**  
- Reading and processing camera frames  
- Applying grayscale, sepia, and sketch filters  

#### **Advanced Enhancements**  
- Switching between color spaces 
- Blurring and smoothing filters  

#### **Gesture-Based & AI Enhancements**  
- Gesture recognition for filter switching  
- Face detection using Haar Cascades  
- Style transfer with AI-powered filters  

#### **Capstone: Live Streaming Filters**  
- Building a user-friendly UI for filter selection.
